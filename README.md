- Name or IP Adress of PowerVC
- Access Credentials for PowerVC (to create LPARs and Network)
- A preconfigured RHEL Image that can be deployed using PowerVC
- Network Ports of PowerVC need to be reachable by Ansible Execution Environment

|:----------------------------------------|

> In the AAP/AWX credentials you can only define the previous parameters for authentication.
> Define the following dictionary in addition to  the OpenStack credential in case you need additional parameters, e.g. `user_domain_name` for authentication:
> <pre>
>     os_add_auth:
>       auth_url: https://powervc:5000/v3/ # mandatory to repeat
>       user_domain_name: Default          # additional parameters for auth section
> </pre>


#### Test the connection by listing disk images from PowerVC

1. Login to your AAP/AWX Controller as admin

3. Click `Add -> Add Job Template`
4. Enter the following parameters
   - Name: e.g `tool - list disk images`
   - Job Type: `Run`
   - Inventory: An inventory that contains localhost

> If everything goes well, you can continue with the next steps.
> If the template fails, you probably have the wrong parameters or you might need to add additional paramters such as `user_domain_name`.

#### Required Variables for Inventory


```yaml
power_machines:
   - vm_create_name: _hostname_
   - vm_create_create_ip: _try without for variable IP_
   - vm_create_flavor: _OpenStack VM Flavor_
   - vm_group_name:
   - vm_create_deploy_target:
```

To see what flavors are available, log in to PowerVC console and click -> VirtualMachines -> Compute Templates
#### Global Variables
<pre>
- os_add_auth: ...

- os_image_filter: _start of image name, e.g rhel86  (os_image_name -> internal use)
- os_availability_zones[os_deploy_target]
- os_network
</pre>

##### Availability Zones

availabiltiy zones are optional to create in PowerVC. In case you want use ability zones configure them in PowerVC and create an array with your availability zones.

**Example Definition**

```yaml
os_availability_zones:
  "AllServers": "AllServers"
  SERVER1: ":900922A_78AD123"
  SERVER2: ":922322H_78C1234"
  SERVER3: ":922322H_78C2345"
```

To deploy a server in an availability zone and the following line to your creation dictionary:
```yaml
- vm_create_deploy_target: SERVER1
```

  openstack.cloud.networks_info:
    auth:
      auth_url: https://identity.example.com
      username: user
      password: password
      project_name: someproject
  register: result
